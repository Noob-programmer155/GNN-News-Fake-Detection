# Welcome to News Fake Detection with GCN’s documentation!

See [Link ‘e.g., Dou et all, 2021’](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12259.pdf) this paper for details of UPTD dataset:

## Description

News Detection system with GCN Convolution layer, with some visualize data
this project has reference on this github project: [Link GNN-FakeNews](https://github.com/safe-graph/GNN-FakeNews)
you can check it for further details about this project

## How To Use


1. Open file [Link gnn.ipynb](https://github.com/Noob-programmer155/GNN-News-Fake-Detection/blob/main/main/gnn.ipynb)


2. run all block

## How To Modify


1. Open file [Link gnn.ipynb](https://github.com/Noob-programmer155/GNN-News-Fake-Detection/blob/main/main/gnn.ipynb)


2. In block 4, change appropriate value that want to tunning it


3. or maybe add new hidden layer and change optimism algorithm
